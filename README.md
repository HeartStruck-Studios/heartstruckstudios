# 💙 Heartstruck Studio

Welcome to **Heartstruck Studio** — my personal indie development space.

My name is **Alec**, and I’m a brand new developer at the very beginning of my programming journey.  
This repository is where I’ll be uploading and organising all of my projects, coursework, experiments, and learning progress as I grow my skills over time.

This is not a collection of perfect or professional-level projects (yet) — it’s a real record of improvement, curiosity, and consistent building.  
Everything here, no matter how small or basic, represents a step forward.

## 🌱 About Me

I’m an aspiring indie developer with a strong interest in technology, creativity, and building things that work.

Right now, I’m focused mainly on:

- **App Development**
- **Web Development**
- Learning core programming concepts through hands-on practice

That said, I have a genuine interest in *all* areas of software and technology, so over time I’ll likely explore many different subjects and sectors — from creative experiments to more technical development projects.

**Heartstruck Studio** is the name I’m using as a creative identity for this journey.

## 🛠️ What This Repository Is For

This repo serves as my main development hub, where I will store:

- Beginner programming projects  
- Practice builds and small experiments  
- Course notes and learning exercises  
- Early prototypes and ideas  
- Larger future projects as my skills improve  

Some projects may be simple at first — but they are part of the process, and I want to document everything as I learn.

## 🎯 My Goals

My long-term goals with Heartstruck Studio are to:

- Build a strong and genuine **portfolio of work**
- Develop real-world skills in software engineering
- Become confident in creating full applications and websites
- Eventually work professionally in **software development**
- Continue improving through consistent learning and building

I want this repository to reflect progress over time — from my first steps to more advanced creations.

## 🚀 Current Focus

At the moment, I am working on improving my understanding of:

- Programming fundamentals  
- Building real projects instead of only theory  
- App and web development workflows  
- Problem solving and development habits  

As I learn more, this repository will grow alongside me.

## 📌 A Note

This is the start of my journey.

Projects here may be basic, unfinished, or experimental — but every upload is part of learning, and every project is a step toward becoming a better developer.

Thanks for visiting **Heartstruck Studio**.

More coming soon.
